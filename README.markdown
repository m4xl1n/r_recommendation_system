# Introduction
For information about this contest, please see the official Kaggle.com contest website or the official contest announcement on Dataists.com.

# Getting Started
To start working on this contest, simply download/clone this repository and run the `example_model.R` script in an R interpreter to see the model how our baseline model works. After that, you can start trying to build a model that makes better predictions on the `data/training_data.csv` data set than our example model.

# Please Note
The `data/installations.csv` file is now available, as is the `data/test_data.csv` file. Obviously, the values of the variable `Installed` are `NA` in both of these data sets.

# Max Lin's submission
